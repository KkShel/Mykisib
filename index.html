<a href="images/cover cover.png"> <img src="images/cover covert.png" width="300" height="450" alt="At the centre of this cover is a portion of a blue alien face. Upper right cheek, brow, and an eye with a bright yellow pupil, appearing to glow, the rest of the eye fading from pink to purple. This face portion is framed by weaving lines that flow from the top left corner, around the face, and then down to the bottom right. They are in various shades of purple and blue, darkest around the face. The title, Mykisib, is centered just above the face, the line of the y extending all the way to the bottom of the image. There are two titles, one white over another in deep pink, giving it a slight three-dimensional effect. In the background there is a silhouette of a head, with green spots and bright pink eyes, partly obscured by the background's lines. In the front lower left there are four small, white heads with only their eyes and lips drawn. They each have different makeup styles and piercings." title="Cover art for Mykisib, &copy;Copyright Kiera Marie Sheldon 2025"> </a>

"The planet Uhust is home to Mykse-Binheso, a travelling Seer and fan of local theatre. Mykse has had a vision of vibrant worlds that exist light-years beyond his star system, and he plans to visit them. All he needs is to find the alien ship that he saw landing in the woods."

This project stemmed from my interest in the alien worlds and cultures of Star Wars. I created a few original characters and ended up with several groups with their own narratives. Eventually, I abandoned the parts that were not originally mine, and <em>Mykisib</em> came into being. I wanted to create alien worlds that did not fall into the tropes of orientalism or euro-centrism, a story that celebrated and explored a diverse setting with respect and care. 
</p>

<p>
Developing this story and setting also serves as a means for me to examine and interpret political and cultural issues that interest me. Sexuality and gender identity, the development of religions and how individuals interpret their beliefs, interpretations on the idea of biological race and how it interacts with culture, how people interact within different class and economic systems, and how worlds develop and change over time; what’s left of the past and how it influences the future. If <em>Mykisib</em> ever gains an audience, I hope that it shows them a thoughtful perspective on life on Earth through a creative, unique, and considerate lens.

<div class="Aboutme">
<p>
I am frequently caught in the midst of a dilemma: I want to learn, but I refuse to read. As a result, I spend a lot of my time pondering and mulling thoughts over instead of finding answers. Developing this work serves as my outlet.
</p>

<p>
While I do take inspiration from some media, there are many works in my favourite genres that I have not seen or read, so I constantly fear that I am accidentally reinventing the wheel. What I’m doing may have been done before, better than I could ever hope to achieve, and I could be completely unaware. Luckily, this is a hobby for my own amusement. It can be as unoriginal or unnecessarily complicated as I care to make it.
