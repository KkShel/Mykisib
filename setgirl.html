<dt> <strong>Uhust</strong> </dt> 
<dd> Our protagonist, Mykse-Binheso, is from the planet Uhust, home of the Conbrynys. </dd>

<dt> <strong>The Inter-System Alliance</strong> </dt>
<dd> 
 <p>
Far from Uhust, there exist a multitude of star-systems with their own inhabited planets and various sentient species. 
 </p>
 <p>
The Alliance was first formed between the Limfurmi of the Great Hive, whose home system had reached capacity, the Pise'ethi of Yecithe, whose nascent industrial revolution had been jump-started by the introduction of the Limfurmi's advanced technologies, and the planet Urecean, whose God-King had become unsatisfied with having influence over the majority of his planet.
 </p>
 <p>
In the current era, the Limfurmi's rapid expansion having been halted by self-reflection and red tape, the Ureceani having deposed their absolutist monarchy with religious zealotry, and Yecithe's rapidly advancing industries having nearly melted the planet into tar, the Alliance now counts among its ranks the planets Pelil, Insegern, and Sanok, each of which have their own wealth of cultural and industrial exports.
 </p>
 <p>
The Alliance's Navy continues to explore the stars in search of new life, as the diverse peoples living within its circle of influence come to terms with their pasts and each other.
 </p> 
</dd>

<dt> <strong> The Outer Rim </strong> </dt>
<dd> This vague title refers to the areas of space that exist at the edge of the Inter-System Allianceâ€™s authority. This is the frontier, the new world, largely uninhabited and newly colonized. Anything beyond the Outer Rim is unknown and barely explored. The communities within it largely exist to evade the watchful eyes of the law.
<br>
This environment is meant to reflect the American Frontier during the early days of American expansion towards the West. Or, perhaps, Las Vegas. Somewhere far from what most people would consider civilization, where laws are a little looser and resources are harder to come by.
