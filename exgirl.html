<h3> The Seer's Perspective, or: Mykse in Suhdonom </h3>

<div id="prologue"> 

<!-- Because this is a lot of text, I have formatted this section to be much plainer than the rest of the site for easier reading -->

<p>
Mykse-Binheso, named after his hometown and the church that raised him, has found himself in the small and bustling town of Suhdonom. He's travelling with the Binheso Theatre Company while they tour their production of <em>The Fisherman of Sybud</em>, keeping up with one of their actors, Senbydo-Dybikis.
</p>

<p>
They've known each other for a few years, now. What began as Mykse's personal interest in the arts and a want to connect with his local community had turned into a close friendship. It's something any travelling priest would be grateful for.
</p>

<p>
Mykse's purpose, as a Seer of the Church, is to provide guidance to those that seek it. He has a gift, the ability to see the Transcendent River, the natural flow of reality, the path that life is meant to follow, and he is meant to help others down that path. The title of Seer brings with it the responsibilities of collecting alms and performing on-request street divination. It does not demand of him an active or engaging life. He could have stayed in Binheso, parked himself on a nice street corner, and spent the rest of his days there holding hands with and advising the same few people, going back to study at the same church library, and becoming a stable and unchanging pillar in his local community. It would have been a good life, though an uninteresting one. 
</p>

<p>
He has instead chosen to explore, firmly believing that the pursuit of new experiences is the best way to gain new knowledge, and that a vast wealth of knowledge is a great asset when helping others. Seeking out strange encounters, alone and in unfamiliar places, is a risk that most Seers wouldn't take. Every tragedy has a protagonist that sees too much and refuses to accept things as they are, who interrupts the natural flow of reality, but Mykse refuses to ignore his inherent curiosity. 
</p>

<p>
Doesn't understanding the world lead to finding a better path? He thinks that if he could promote the pursuit of knowledge to others, allow people to see for themselves the patterns that life wants to follow and develop new perspectives on their situations, the people of Uhust could work together towards a better and kinder future. He just needs to make sure he stays on the <em>gathering information to make informed decisions and have a balanced perspective</em> side of things and not drift into the territory of <em>obsessing over unavoidable tragedy and thus bringing about the destruction of civilized society.</em>
</p>

<p>
Mykse had, some years back, read into the historical and current records of the local theatre scene. Any native of Uhust can tell you the importance of a good drama, that histories and parables are best communicated through spoken word, in costume, on a stage in front of a crowd. Actors play a similar role to Seers in certain respects, bringing important messages from the Church to the public, helping to guide them. Any good tale has a moral, an action and a consequence, an ideal to promote, or a lesson to teach. Mykse had read every text the Binheso Church Library had on the subject. Then he went to hear about it from the actors themselves.
</p>

<p>
The lead actor of the local troupe, Senbydo-Dybikis, had plenty of stories to tell. Mykse and Senbydo had become close over time, and what eventually convinced Mykse to travel with the troupe were Senbydo's vivid descriptions of towering Old-World ruins and the vastness of the sea, and anecdotes about the people he'd met. A travelling actor's life led to the exact kind of new and enlightening adventures that Mykse was looking for. He saw no choice but to come along.
</p>

<p>
And so, Mykse finds himself here, in Suhdonom, sitting cross legged in the shadow of a local tavern. He'll hold out his palms from time to time to offer guidance, and meditate on his own in between. After that, he has a show to see.
