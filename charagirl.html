<strong> Mikmokapimwamaba </strong>
<br>
Miko is an old and ancient being that encompasses forces of nature and spiritual connection, a deity that has sequestered herself away from mortal influence and attention. She has quietly resided in her own corner of the universe for a long time, avoiding the violence of corrupt government control and enforced social hierarchies once she recognised that they were developing.
</p>
<p>
She takes on the form of an ordinary mortal, but there are other parts of her divine consciousness that exist elsewhere. One of them is the guiding voice that Mykse and his fellow Seers depend on to make sense of the Transcendent River. They have never seen her, and she does not know them in a way that is fully aware or intentional, but a part of her is entwined with their practices.
</p>
<p>
Miko has had time to consider whether it is right or advisable to hide away as she has, and has recently made attempts to walk further into the mortal realm and connect with the people she is spiritually tied to.

<p>
The ship currently known as the Nemesis Mi’ithir was once one of the Alliance’s Frontier Exploration ships, the Aqua-4. An engineer of theirs, Mi’ithir, was deemed unfit for service and terminated, her body taken to be recycled into materials to feed other workers. The remaining crew went rogue, mutinying against any officers that still answered to a government that valued productivity over life. 
</p>
<p>
The Aqua-4 was officially decommissioned after its crew defected, no longer registered but still found sailing under a different name and deliberately sabotaging the Alliance’s expansion efforts. The ship now runs on an eight-person skeleton crew. Two members who joined after their decommissioning are Distif and Hirmithi, a small-planet pilot going off on her own and a robot being hunted for “stealing” her own body.

<p>
The Burgundy-7 is a small intra-system research vessel headed by Captain Sayad Alisp' Inedn'es epd', the former Chief Officer of the Aqua-4. He was given a promotion for doing his due diligence and reporting their mutiny, but since he failed to prevent them from going rogue he is now under high scrutiny and in charge of the Alliance's least-wanted recruits.
</p>
<p>
The crew members of the Burgundy-7 can largely be characterized as individuals who either dedicated more time to personal pursuits than the job, had taken on roles deemed inappropriate for their capabilities, or who were relegated to small-time research because more respectable crews did not want to work with them. Sayad and his Chief Officer, Guntog, have been tasked with either straightening them out into a proper crew or signing off on their removal from service.
